create status to string function and string to status function
create error flags and bit fields in flags so cnc can set if errors happen
create start of program sequence that enables motors
create end of program sequence that disables motors
create home sequence that runs to max in z and then to offset for zero
create wait opcode and create wait function on cnc using the timers
could use wait opcode to test interrupt speed and figure out clock...

need to make config file that loads on pi when you start
need to add 'h' to user input and start homing state machine to find new home
need to make "Save home" position that it starts on and then final home position
can adjust left motor first and then right motor second... actually nvmd - should lock and adjust endstops instead of adjusting motors... actually we should adjust left and right and then adjust top to account for it
need to fix homing state opcode on micro
create function to open and write config file
create function to send config data to the micro
save parameters in the main struct... common_cnc

To Do:
Raspberry Pi:
add single/instantaneous instruction passing to micro through spi
make start input and then send that to micro as handshake then move to input stage then have handshake to close/stop

finish instruction/program state that reads off instructions from the list and pauses/continues as needed
while also handling input for stopping and resetting or just quitting

make pause/continue spi command/instruction

parse gcode file more fully and handle all odd commands
finish gcode parsing for mm/inch and absolute or relative movements
create states to latch linear/arc/other and current tool/extruder


Micro Controller:
remove "start program" (and maybe instruction numbers) and allow single instructions... essentially always ready for instructions
add (verify) "reset program" functionality to clear any pending instructions (reset the buffer)

create ramp for speeds across all axes
finish heater/temp stuff
create pid loop for heater/temp
create heater setting/clearing instructions

make pause/continue spi command instruction

update zero instruction to add z functionality
make zero adjustment state that will set the z location

Both:
make config file and file saving for the system... you can choose 3d printing or cnc or others... and save off zero positioning and stuff...
