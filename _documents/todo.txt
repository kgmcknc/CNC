To Do:
Raspberry Pi:
add single/instantaneous instruction passing to micro through spi
make start input and then send that to micro as handshake then move to input stage then have handshake to close/stop

finish instruction/program state that reads off instructions from the list and pauses/continues as needed
while also handling input for stopping and resetting or just quitting

make pause/continue spi command/instruction

parse gcode file more fully and handle all odd commands
finish gcode parsing for mm/inch and absolute or relative movements
create states to latch linear/arc/other and current tool/extruder


Micro Controller:
remove "start program" (and maybe instruction numbers) and allow single instructions... essentially always ready for instructions
add (verify) "reset program" functionality to clear any pending instructions (reset the buffer)

create ramp for speeds across all axes
finish heater/temp stuff
create pid loop for heater/temp
create heater setting/clearing instructions

make pause/continue spi command instruction

update zero instruction to add z functionality
make zero adjustment state that will set the z location

Both:
Fix defines for print lengths and spi transactions... make that make sense...
Verify spi behavior and gpio (maybe make way to break out of condition when spi is waiting for something that won't ever happen... like wrong length)
Hard code some spi lengths that are variable (like prints?) or just verify failsafe/error...

make config file and file saving for the system... you can choose 3d printing or cnc or others... and save off zero positioning and stuff...
